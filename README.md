## üìï Repo Structure

In this repo I have written code to:
- Build Docker containers  
- Use PyTorch Lightning for high-performance ML  
- Manage data & models with DVC  
- Deploy with FastAPI, Gradio, and TorchServe  
- Orchestrate with Kubernetes  
- Implement **Canary Deployments** with **monitoring**  
- Complete a **Project** to deploy an end-to-end MLOps pipeline
