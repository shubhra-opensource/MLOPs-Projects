# 🚀 Overview of MLOps Best Practices and Tools

## 📖 Introduction to MLOps
In traditional software development, **DevOps** practices make it possible to ship software to production quickly and reliably. DevOps relies on automation, workflows, and tooling to minimize complexity so developers can focus on solving problems.  

But why can’t we apply the same approach to **machine learning (ML)**?  
👉 The difference is that ML is **not just code — it’s code + data**.  

ML models often fail to make it to production, or they break quickly because they cannot adapt to changing environments. This is where **MLOps** comes in.

## ⚡ DevOps vs MLOps
**DevOps** automates building, testing, and deploying code. Once code is pushed, it runs tests, integrates, and deploys automatically.  

**MLOps**, on the other hand, extends this to include:  
- Data preprocessing  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Versioning of data, code, and models  
- Continuous deployment of improved models  

MLOps provides **standardized processes and technology capabilities** for building, deploying, and maintaining ML systems **rapidly and reliably**.

## 🔑 Core Principles of MLOps
MLOps builds on DevOps while addressing ML-specific challenges. Key practices include:

### 1. 🤝 Collaboration
- Vision model example: data scientists + engineers + domain experts define labeling strategies for autonomous driving. 
- Language model example: data scientists + linguists build sentiment analysis datasets and categories.

### 2. ⚙️ Automation
- Automate preprocessing (e.g., resizing images, tokenization, normalization).  
- Use pipelines to ensure consistent and scalable data preparation.

### 3. 📂 Version Control
- Track code, data, model architectures, and parameters using **Git** + specialized tools (DVC, MLflow).  
- Enables reproducibility and rollback.

### 4. 🔄 CI/CD for ML
- Automate model training, evaluation, and deployment.  
- Deploy new models only if metrics (e.g., F1-score, mAP, precision/recall) improve.  
- Tools: **GitHub Actions**, **Jenkins**, **Kubeflow Pipelines**.

### 5. 📊 Monitoring & Governance
- Monitor metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and drift detection.  
- Track data quality, bias, and ethical risks.  
- Tools: **Prometheus**, **Evidently AI**, **WhyLabs**.

### 6. 🔬 Reproducibility
- Save datasets, hyperparameters, and training pipelines.  
- Ensure experiments are replicable by others.  
- Tools: **MLflow**, **Weights & Biases**.

## 🌐 Examples in Practice
- **Vision Models** → automated preprocessing (resize, augment), CI/CD pipelines, model monitoring for accuracy drift.  
- **Language Models** → automated NLP preprocessing (tokenization, stemming), CI/CD for retraining, governance for bias detection.  

Both rely on **MLOps principles**: collaboration, automation, reproducibility, and monitoring.

## 💡 Supporting Tools for Practitioners
When working in production environments, some Linux/DevOps basics are essential:

- **SSH** → securely connect to remote systems.  
- **Vim** → lightweight text editing.  
- **htop / ps** → monitor processes.  
- **scp / rsync** → transfer and sync data.  
- **tmux** → manage long-running ML training sessions in terminal.

## 📌 Summary
MLOps is about **bridging the gap between ML research and production systems**. It builds upon DevOps but adds crucial capabilities:  

✅ Manage **code + data + models**  
✅ Automate preprocessing, training, and deployment  
✅ Ensure reproducibility with versioning  
✅ Monitor models continuously in production  
✅ Foster collaboration between data scientists, engineers, and domain experts  

By following these best practices and leveraging modern tools, organizations can deploy and maintain ML models **reliably, ethically, and at scale**.
